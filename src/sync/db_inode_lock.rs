//! SQLite-compatible exclusive advisory locking for the beads database inode.
//!
//! # Why this module exists (GitHub #412)
//!
//! The database-family write authority must hold an exclusive advisory lock on
//! the database *inode itself* so hard-link aliases of one physical database
//! cannot acquire two independent authorities. v0.2.20 implemented that lock
//! with [`std::fs::File::try_lock`], which is `flock(LOCK_EX)` on Unix and a
//! whole-file `LockFileEx` on Windows. That is safe for dedicated lock
//! sidecars (`.write.lock`, `.br-db-write-*.lock`) but catastrophically wrong
//! for the SQLite database file, because the SQLite engine (frankensqlite)
//! places its own advisory locks on that same inode:
//!
//! - **macOS / BSD:** `flock` locks and POSIX `fcntl` record locks live in one
//!   kernel lock table and conflict with each other — *even inside a single
//!   process*, because a `flock` is owned by its open file description while a
//!   POSIX record lock is owned by the process. Holding `flock(LOCK_EX)` on
//!   the database made every subsequent frankensqlite `fcntl(F_SETLK)` fail
//!   with `EAGAIN`, surfacing as "Database error: database is busy" on a
//!   freshly initialised workspace.
//! - **Windows:** `LockFileEx` locks are mandatory. A whole-file exclusive
//!   lock both collides with the engine's own lock-byte ranges and blocks
//!   plain reads through any other handle, so even the schema header became
//!   unreadable ("database schema is missing or unreadable").
//! - **Linux:** `flock` and POSIX record locks never interact, which is the
//!   only reason the defect stayed invisible on the primary development
//!   platform.
//!
//! # The fix
//!
//! Lock exactly **one byte at an offset the SQLite engine never locks and no
//! database ever stores data at** ([`DATABASE_INODE_LOCK_OFFSET`]), using a
//! lock family that composes with the engine on every supported platform:
//!
//! - **Unix (Linux, Android, macOS, iOS):** an open-file-description lock
//!   (`fcntl(F_OFD_SETLK)`), which conflicts range-wise with other OFD and
//!   POSIX locks — giving cross-process (and cross-authority, same-process)
//!   exclusion — but never overlaps SQLite's lock-byte range
//!   (`0x4000_0000..0x4000_0200`). Unlike classic `F_SETLK` process locks,
//!   OFD locks are *not* dropped when the process closes an unrelated file
//!   descriptor for the same inode (the engine opens and closes connections
//!   freely while the authority is held), and two authorities in one process
//!   still conflict because each has its own open file description.
//! - **Windows:** a one-byte `LockFileEx` at the same offset. The offset is
//!   far beyond any real database size, so the mandatory-lock semantics can
//!   never block the engine's I/O, and the engine's own lock ranges never
//!   overlap it.
//! - **Other Unix (unsupported release targets):** falls back to
//!   `File::try_lock` (`flock`), preserving pre-existing behavior.
//!
//! The lock is released when the `File` (its open file description / handle)
//! is closed, exactly like the previous `try_lock` semantics, so the
//! surrounding authority state machine (`retired_locks`, rebind, restore) is
//! unchanged.
//!
//! This module is the crate's single sanctioned `unsafe` exemption: the two
//! syscalls (`fcntl` / `LockFileEx`) have no safe wrapper covering OFD locks
//! on macOS (`nix` gates `F_OFD_SETLK` to linux/android) or byte-range locks
//! on Windows. Everything else in the crate remains `#![deny(unsafe_code)]`.

/// - No real database file can reach this offset (SQLite's maximum database

/// Re-invoking on the same `File` while the byte is already held by that same
