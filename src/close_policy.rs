//! Closure-time policy gates (issue #274 — Phase 1).
//!
//! Loads `.beads/policy.yaml` (when present) and evaluates configured gates
//! against a candidate close. Every gate is opt-in. With no policy file,
//! [`ClosePolicy::is_active`] returns `false` and `br close` behaves exactly
//! as it did before this module existed.
//!
//! # Phase 1 scope
//!
//! - Required-field validation (close reason min length / regex; unchecked
//!   acceptance criteria boxes)
//! - Actor constraints (forbid self-close after `in_progress` was set by the
//!   same actor)
//! - Agent attribution Tier 1 (capture, never reject) via env vars + CLI flags
//! - Typed structured references in close reasons
//!
//! Long-form closeout documents, signatures, and full observability are
//! intentionally out of scope.
