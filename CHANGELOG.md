## v0.3.1 -- 2026-08-14 (Release)

Same-day follow-up to v0.3.0: asupersync moved to 0.4.4, the lockfile was
refreshed to latest-compatible across the graph, and two load-sensitive
release-gate tests were repaired.

### Dependencies

- asupersync 0.4.3 → 0.4.4 (with its franken-kernel/evidence/decision
  family). Upstream 0.4.x preserves the 0.4.3 public API; the notable 0.4.4
  change (spawned-task results surviving cancellation acknowledgement) does
  not affect br's block_on bridge, which spawns no tasks.
- Pinned the Rust toolchain to `nightly-2026-08-13` so local, RCH, and
  cross-platform release builds use the same compiler, rustfmt, and Clippy
  lint inventory instead of resolving a host-dependent floating nightly.
- Full `cargo update` lockfile refresh: ~45 transitive crates to latest
  compatible (aho-corasick 1.1.5, aws-lc-rs 1.18, blake3 1.8.6, cc 1.4.3,
  futures 0.3.34 family, http 1.5, icu 2.3 family, and others). Direct
  dependencies were already at latest stable (sha2 0.11, rand 0.10,
  signal-hook 0.4.4, similar 3.1.2); the deliberate holdouts remain
  self_update (pre-release pin), cap-primitives (=4.0.2 by design), and
  fastmcp-rust's own asupersync 0.3.10 line (awaiting its 0.4.x republish).

### Fixed

- v0.3.0's `darwin_amd64` release asset (and its `darwin_x86_64` alias)
  contained an arm64 binary: the local-release pipeline built the Intel slot
  on an Apple Silicon host without forcing `--target x86_64-apple-darwin`,
  so Intel Macs downloaded a binary that cannot run. The v0.3.0 assets were
  rebuilt from the same tag and replaced in place (checksums regenerated,
  Rosetta-verified), and the release pipeline now pins the cross target for
  the darwin/amd64 slot. v0.2.22 and earlier were unaffected (CI built them
  with explicit targets).
- The installer's `/tmp/br-install.lock` now honors `TMPDIR` (POSIX
  convention), and the installer test suite plants its deliberately stale
  lock inside a per-test TMPDIR — parallel installer tests could previously
  race each other's recovery of the shared planted lock.
- The concurrent `sync --flush-only` failure-injection scenario now drains
  both subprocesses simultaneously. Previously, inherited verbose dependency
  tracing could fill the lock holder's captured stderr while the harness was
  synchronously waiting on the losing child, creating a test-only pipe/lock
  deadlock. The repair was verified with a live GDB backtrace and 50 repeated
  contention runs.
- The sync-merge receipt boundary scenario now asserts its actual semantic
  precondition (`receipt cutoff < tombstone expiry`) instead of requiring an
  arbitrary five seconds of unused headroom, removing load-sensitive false
  failures without weakening the post-expiry replay proof.

## v0.3.0 -- 2026-08-14 (Release)

Storage-engine generation upgrade: FrankenSQLite 0.1.18 → 0.3.1 with the
asupersync 0.4.3 runtime, plus the accumulated test/lint debt cleanup from
the doctor/sync workstream merge (GitHub #409) and a set of verified bug
fixes. Version moves to 0.3.0 because fsqlite types are part of br's public
library API (`BeadsError::Database(FrankenError)`, storage signatures), and
swapping the fsqlite major line through that surface is a breaking change
for library consumers. CLI behavior is compatible apart from the fixes
below.

### FrankenSQLite 0.3.1 + asupersync 0.4.3 (storage engine generation)

- fsqlite 0.2.0 made the engine API `async` end to end and 0.3.0 moved its
  runtime family to asupersync 0.4.3. br's storage layer stays fully
  synchronous through the new `src/franken_sync.rs` facade: a thread-local
  current-thread asupersync runtime drives each `!Send` engine future to
  completion on the calling thread (`Runtime::block_on`), taken out of its
  slot while polling so reentrant SQL builds a fresh runtime instead of
  re-entering the same one. The facade adds a bounded `BusyRecovery` retry
  (fsqlite 0.2+ open-recovery windows fail fast where 0.1.x waited) and a
  stale-schema `prepare()` refresh retry (cross-connection DDL visibility).
- The engine upgrade brings the fsqlite 0.3.x correctness wave to br
  workspaces, including the allocator page-aliasing, committed-freelist
  resurrection, and concurrent-writer EOF-growth fixes behind the B-tree /
  freelist corruption classes reported in GitHub #426 and #428, and the
  concurrent-open `BusyRecovery` retry fix behind multi-agent open storms.
- New direct dependency `asupersync = "=0.4.3"` (default-features off),
  matching the fsqlite family requirement exactly. The optional `mcp`
  feature still carries fastmcp-rust 0.3.2's independent asupersync 0.3.x
  line until FastMCP republishes on 0.4.x; the two coexist as distinct
  crates.

### Engine-upgrade adaptations in the storage layer

- The doctor's SQLite file-family audits now cover fsqlite 0.2+'s
  parallel-WAL durability-certificate sidecars (`-wal-cert`,
  `-wal-cert-head`) alongside the classic and namespace sidecars, so legacy
  repair audits account for the whole on-disk family.
- Writable connections, including explicit read-write compatibility opens,
  select the engine's serialized mode at open
  (`PRAGMA fsqlite.concurrent_mode = OFF`), matching br's existing workspace
  write-lock serialization (#243). This avoids a concurrent-mode
  `BusySnapshot` self-conflict when a legacy schema migration copies from a
  table and drops that source in the same transaction, while preserving the
  migration's original crash-atomic copy/drop/rename boundary.
- Missing-database JSONL recovery quarantines the complete orphaned fsqlite
  0.3 sidecar family (`-wal-cert`, `-wal-cert-head`, `-fsqlite-ns-gate`, and
  `-fsqlite-ns-use`) into verified `.br_recovery` backups before initializing
  the replacement database, preserving the old bytes without letting stale
  engine state block or contaminate the rebuild.
- The sync bridge retries `BusySnapshot` on self-contained autocommit
  statements (the statement is the whole transaction, so retrying it is
  exactly the engine contract's "retry the whole transaction"), in addition
  to the existing bounded `BusyRecovery` retry.

### Missing database no longer deadlocks recovery (GitHub #414, #420, #409 cluster A)

- A missing `beads.db` cannot contain a pending sync-merge receipt, but the
  startup gate treated the *inability to inspect* it as a fail-closed
  refusal — so a JSONL-only checkout (or a deleted database) was locked out
  of `br init`, `br sync --import-only --rebuild`, `br doctor --repair`, and
  every no-db-then-import flow, and a stray ancestor `.beads/` without a
  database blocked `br init` for every directory beneath it. Startup now
  classifies a definitively-absent database as "no pending merge": the
  advisory inspection treats NotFound as absent, and the mutation gate binds
  the absent inode under the held database-family authority so the
  subsequent writable open can initialize or rebuild without an unchecked
  replacement window. (Equivalent fix independently proposed in PR #422 —
  thanks!)

### `br list --status` rejects unknown values (GitHub #418)

- `br list --status all` is now the same meta-value `br lint` accepts (no
  status filter), and an unrecognized status value is a validation error
  naming the built-in vocabulary instead of silently matching zero issues
  with exit code 0. Custom statuses stay first-class: a value declared in
  `.beads/policy.yaml` (`workflow.statuses`) or present on at least one
  issue in the database passes validation.

### `br blocked` rich output keeps line breaks (PR #421)

- Prepared rich `Text` records in the blocked renderer went through a path
  that dropped each Text's line ending, collapsing headers, issue rows, and
  detail rows onto one line in rich mode. They now render through
  `print_text`, which honors the ending. (Diagnosis matches PR #421 —
  thanks!)

### Routed mutations no longer self-deadlock on the target write lock

- Routed `update`, `close`, `defer`, `undefer`, `delete`, and `reopen`
  against an external workspace (`.beads/routes.jsonl`) acquired the
  target's database-family write lock but never marked it as held before
  the storage open tried to take the same `.beads/.write.lock` from a
  second descriptor in the same process — flock-style locks conflict
  across descriptors, so every routed mutation hung until the 30s lock
  timeout. They now mark the held lock the same way `comments`, `dep`,
  `label`, and the read-side routed commands always did.

### Read-only fast open restored (with its migration barrier intact)

- Read-only commands that waive auto-import and auto-flush
  (`--no-auto-import --no-auto-flush list/show/ready/...`) again bypass the
  startup writer-lock queue and open the current-schema database read-only,
  re-landing the fast-open contract from 1b75961a that the #412 rescue
  snapshot (251b501b) had reverted — a held `.write.lock` no longer blocks
  the whole read matrix, and `sync --reconcile --dry-run` proceeds under
  lock contention as documented.
- The conservative path's implicit-migration barrier moved with it: a
  fast-open miss on an existing database now re-runs the pending-merge and
  schema-version inspection under the database-family authority it acquires
  for the writable fallback, so a stale-schema database still refuses into
  the reviewed `br doctor migrate-schema plan` workflow (and a pending sync
  merge still refuses writable recovery) instead of silently auto-migrating.

### `br serve` no longer deadlocks against its own startup lock

- The MCP server acquired the database-family write lock at startup (for
  the pending-merge mutation gate and a preopened storage context), then
  `run_serve` and every per-request mutation handler tried to take the same
  flock through fresh descriptors in the same process — so `br serve` hung
  before ever reaching the stdio transport, and SIGINT could not shut it
  down. Serve now skips the storage preopen entirely, releases the gate
  authority (and its marked `Arc` clones) once the pending-merge verdict is
  final, and the server plus its handlers manage locking per request as
  designed. Combined with cancel-context wiring through
  `run_transport_returning_with_cx`, SIGINT/SIGTERM now terminate `br
  serve` promptly.

### Flush anchor publication is fail-closed again

- `br sync` flush certified an export and cleared dirty state even when
  publishing the `beads.base.jsonl` merge anchor failed, leaving `sync
  --status` reporting "In sync" while the three-way-merge ancestor was
  stale. The anchor is published before export finalization again and a
  publication failure is a hard error naming the anchor path; dirty state
  stays set so a plain retry flush converges.

### CI supply-chain inventory refreshed

- The merged actions-group bump (#406) updated workflow SHA pins without
  refreshing `.github/action-pins.jsonl` / `action-pin-upstreams.jsonl`;
  the inventory now records the same upstream-verified identities
  (actions/checkout v7.0.1, dtolnay/rust-toolchain default-branch head
  2026-07-16, taiki-e/install-action v2.85.5, actions/setup-go v7.0.0,
  softprops/action-gh-release v3.0.2), each SHA re-verified against its
  upstream tag before recording.

### Test and lint debt paid down (GitHub #409)

- Startup-gate cluster A is fixed in code (above); stale schema-version
  literals now assert against `CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION`; the stranded
  additive-reconciliation test drives the real `br create` surface instead
  of an unimplemented `--id` flag; drifted message assertions accept the
  current write-lock refusal contract.
- `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` is green again: ~100
  pedantic/nursery findings in the merged workstream code were fixed
  individually (used-underscore renames, by-ref parameters, heap-allocating
  the 1 MiB / 64 KiB stack buffers, boxing the large
  `PendingSyncMergeInspection::Valid` variant, `let...else` rewrites,
  merged match arms, `trailing_zeros` bit tests), with documented targeted
  allows where a change would break cross-file contracts. The 2026-08
  nightly's new `assert_is_empty` style lint joined the crate's stylistic
  allow-list.

### Dependencies

- clap 4.6.6, clap_complete 4.6.9, schemars 1.2.2, similar 3.1.2,
  toml =1.1.4 (dev), plus lockfile refreshes (thiserror 2.0.20,
  libc 0.2.189, once_cell 1.21.4, regex 1.13.1, flate2 1.1.9, lru 0.18.2
  for RUSTSEC-2026-0253). Supersedes Dependabot PR #425.

### Validation

- Full `cargo test --all-features --no-fail-fast` on the release tree:
  21,490 passed, 0 failed (doctests included), up from 21,415 passed /
  70 failed at the start of the migration wave.
- `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings` clean
  (pedantic + nursery at deny); `cargo fmt --check` clean.
- Repo `.beads` database migrated v15 → v17 through the reviewed
  `doctor migrate-schema` plan/apply workflow (rehearsed on an isolated
  copy first; receipts under `.beads/.br_recovery/schema-migrations/`,
  post-apply integrity verified with both engines).

## v0.2.22 -- 2026-08-06 (Release)

Windows companion fix to v0.2.21 (GitHub #412 follow-up).

### Windows database-identity witness no longer tracks content

- On Windows the database-inode authority witnessed file identity as
  `(length, mtime)` — values the SQLite engine changes on every write — so
  after v0.2.21 removed the whole-file lock conflict, the very next check
  failed with "Database inode changed while its write authority was held"
  and Windows workspaces were still unusable after `br init`. The witness now
  uses the file creation time, which is stable across in-place writes and
  changes on atomic replacement, matching the (dev, inode) semantics the
  authority has always used on Unix. Linux and macOS binaries are unchanged
  apart from the version number.

---

## v0.2.21 -- 2026-08-05 (Release)

Emergency fix for a v0.2.20 regression that made workspaces unusable on
macOS and Windows.

### Database-family authority no longer fights the SQLite engine

- v0.2.20's database-family write authority locked the database inode with a
  whole-file OS lock (`flock` on Unix, whole-file `LockFileEx` on Windows).
  The SQLite engine holds its own advisory locks on that same inode, and on
  macOS/BSD `flock` and POSIX record locks share one kernel lock table (they
  conflict even within a single process), while on Windows `LockFileEx` is
  mandatory and blocked even schema-header reads. Every command after
  `br init` failed with `Database error: database is busy` (macOS) or
  `database schema is missing or unreadable` (Windows); Linux was unaffected
  only because `flock` and record locks never interact there
  ([#412](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/issues/412)).
- The inode authority is now a one-byte range lock at `i64::MAX - 1` — an
  offset the engine never locks and no database ever reaches — via
  `fcntl(F_OFD_SETLK)` on Unix and a one-byte `LockFileEx` on Windows.
  Hard-link-alias exclusion (the reason the inode lock exists) is preserved
  and now covered by a regression test, as is engine open/query under a held
  authority.
- The same conflict masked stale-schema detection: a pre-v17 database now
  surfaces the reviewed `SchemaMismatch` migration guidance again instead of
  an unactionable "busy" error that also blocked `br doctor`.

---

## v0.2.19 -- 2026-07-11 (Release)

This release restores downloadable binaries after the tag-only `v0.2.18` cut
and makes identifier allocation and doctor repair behavior fail closed under
the edge cases found during release verification.

### Identifier correctness

- MCP issue creation now derives adaptive hash sizing from the real database
  issue count instead of a constant placeholder
  ([#381](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/issues/381)).
- Identifier generation propagates lookup failures, checks every candidate,
  and returns an explicit collision error after bounded exhaustion instead of
  ever returning an unchecked identifier.
- Empty or unusable configured prefixes are rejected consistently across CLI,
  configuration, MCP startup, and the core ID API. Property, saturation,
  storage-parity, and MCP regressions cover the complete allocation contract.

### Doctor and sync reliability

- Clean JSONL exports now materialize the merge anchor after all content
  normalizers run, so the anchor is byte-identical to the final exported file
  ([#378](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/issues/378)).
- A stale-by-mtime but byte-identical merge anchor is now an idempotent doctor
  no-op: no backup or repair action is recorded when no bytes would change.
- The binary-version detector stops at the nearest package manifest, avoiding
  false beads_rust matches for unrelated repositories nested below the source
  checkout.
- Release fixtures retain the fail-closed repeated-repair contract, while the
  registry-clean lockfile keeps `cargo publish --locked` reproducible.

### CLI and distribution

- Blocked close errors identify the actual blockers and make the explicit
  override discoverable ([#380](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/issues/380)).
- The self-updater is migrated to the current `self_update` API and its
  replacement helper, with strict Clippy coverage retained.
- The release also includes the post-`v0.2.16` dependency-import, tombstone,
  wrapping, schema-repair, and MCP reliability fixes that were present in the
  tag-only `v0.2.18` source cut.

### Validation

- Full unit and integration suite, all-target compiler check, strict all-target
  Clippy, rustfmt, targeted doctor regressions, UBS, and the release reliability
  matrix.
- Native/cross release artifacts are architecture-checked and smoke-tested
  before the annotated tag is published.

## v0.2.11 -- 2026-05-21 (Release)

This version stops the ephemeral "in-memory" storage path from leaking
temporary database files into `TMPDIR`.

### Fixes

- `SqliteStorage::open_memory()` is backed by a real temp file
  (`beads_mem_<pid>_<count>.db`) rather than `:memory:`, because FrankenSQLite
  requires real file paths for WAL and schema operations. That file -- and any
  `-wal`/`-shm`/`-journal` sidecars SQLite created next to it -- was never
  cleaned up, so JSONL-only / in-memory paths (`br sync --import-only`, `br
  ready --no-db`, `br list --no-db`, and similar) left stale `beads_mem_*`
  files in the user temp directory on every invocation. Under high-frequency
  agent/CI use these accumulated into real disk pressure
  ([#299](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/issues/299)).
- The storage layer now tracks the ephemeral temp path and removes the base
  file plus all sidecars on `Drop` (including the signal-induced shutdown
  path), and also cleans up if construction fails partway through. Persistent
  databases are never touched.

### Validation

- Reproduced the issue's exact scenario against a release build and confirmed
  zero `beads_mem_*` files remain in `TMPDIR` after each command exits.
- Added regression tests asserting the temp file exists while the storage is
  open and is gone (with sidecars) after drop.

## v0.2.10 -- 2026-05-14 (Release)

This version supersedes `v0.2.9` by fixing the remaining Windows release-build
portability issue in the doctor subsystem and tightening installer integrity
failure handling.

### Release Fixes

- Kept the `mimalloc` Windows exclusion from `v0.2.9`, which removed the
  MinGW `libmimalloc-sys` C build failure.
- Gated POSIX-only doctor permission checks behind Unix `cfg`s and added
  conservative non-Unix handling for repair backups, chmod-style operations,
  symlink creation, and undo artifact permissions so the Windows release target
  compiles again.
- Re-cut the release after `v0.2.9` had already been published to crates.io,
  because crates.io package versions are immutable and the Windows doctor
  portability fix changes the release source.
- Installer checksum mismatches now fail closed instead of falling back to a
  source build after artifact verification fails; the regression test now uses
  a local file URL so release-preparation runs do not block on network fallback
  behavior.
- Package-manager manifest templates now track the DSR-published
  `br-<version>-<platform>` archive names and current `v0.2.10` checksums, so
  future manifest automation does not keep looking for stale `br-v...` assets.
- The installer and release workflow now keep the tag name (`vX.Y.Z`) separate
  from package asset names (`br-X.Y.Z-...`), preventing future binary installs
  and manifest updates from disagreeing about release artifact URLs.

### Validation

- `v0.2.10` validation includes the dependency-update checks from `v0.2.8`, the
  allocator fix from `v0.2.9`, and a focused
  `cargo check --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu --release` pass covering the
  Windows doctor portability fix.
- Post-release fresh-eyes validation also checked the Homebrew/Scoop/AUR
  manifest templates against the published DSR assets.
- Follow-up validation traced the same asset naming rule through `install.sh`,
  `br upgrade`, and the release workflow fragment harness.

## v0.2.9 -- 2026-05-14 (Crates.io, superseded)

This version superseded `v0.2.8` by removing the dependency-level Windows
allocator failure after the dependency refresh, but was itself superseded by
`v0.2.10` for a separate doctor portability fix.

### Release Fixes

- Kept `mimalloc` enabled for Linux and macOS builds, but removed it from
  Windows builds so the MinGW release target no longer fails inside
  `libmimalloc-sys`' bundled C build.
- Re-cut the release after `v0.2.8` had already been published to crates.io,
  because crates.io package versions are immutable and the Windows build fix
  changes the release source.

### Validation

- `v0.2.9` validation includes the same dependency-update checks as `v0.2.8`,
  plus a Windows release-build retry proving the MinGW allocator failure was
  replaced by a separate doctor portability issue.

## v0.2.8 -- 2026-05-14 (Crates.io, superseded)

This version refreshes the dependency stack, including the local `/dp` FastMCP and frankensqlite libraries now published on crates.io, and tightens storage reliability around the updated SQLite engine.

### Dependency Updates

- Updated the fsqlite stack used by storage and sync paths to the latest published local versions: `fsqlite*` `0.1.3` and `fsqlite-vfs` `0.1.4`.
- Confirmed the direct dependency set is otherwise current with `cargo outdated --root-deps-only`.
- Updated `fastmcp-rust` and its FastMCP crate family to `0.3.1`.

### Reliability

- Kept explicit `--lock-timeout` reads on the conservative storage-open path, so users asking for lock-aware behavior do not accidentally route through the read-only fast-open bypass.
- Reduced noisy expected fsqlite diagnostics during transient WAL tail-read fallback while preserving warnings for unexpected blocked-cache failures.
- Tightened concurrency and doctor chokepoint tests around the updated storage behavior.

### Validation

- Passed `cargo check --all-targets --all-features`.
- Passed `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`.
- Passed `cargo fmt --check` and `git diff --check`.
- Passed `cargo test --all-features --no-fail-fast`, including doctests.
- Passed `cargo publish --dry-run --locked --allow-dirty` for `beads_rust v0.2.8`.

## [v0.1.33](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/releases/tag/v0.1.33) -- 2026-03-23 (Release)

This release supersedes the partial `v0.1.32` fallback build by fixing release automation so `dsr` can produce installer-compatible assets deterministically.

### Release and CI

- **Rust cache pinning** was updated across all GitHub workflows to the current signed `Swatinem/rust-cache` v2.9.1 commit after the prior pinned SHA stopped resolving and broke fallback builds.
- **Release builds now fail closed on missing artifacts**: Linux ARM64 and Windows AMD64 are treated as required release outputs instead of being silently omitted from a published release.
- **Cross-platform fallback coverage improved** by moving Linux ARM64 and Windows AMD64 fallback builds onto Linux-based cross-compilation paths, reducing dependence on specialized remote runners for those targets.

### Testing

- **Single-issue graph rendering** now preserves DFS subtree order in plain output so dependents render contiguously instead of visually nesting under later siblings.
- **List output regression coverage** now reflects the actual plain-output behavior for unknown custom statuses, keeping release validation aligned with user-visible CLI output.

## [v0.1.32](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/releases/tag/v0.1.32) -- 2026-03-23 (Release)

This release extends cross-project routing coverage, hardens storage for frankensqlite compatibility, and tightens the release pipeline around version and installer correctness.

### Cross-Project Routing

- **Route-aware dependency operations** now auto-flush correctly and enforce cross-project guards when adding or removing dependencies ([`4682499`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/4682499)).
- **Graph, delete, audit log, and lint** now respect external workspace routing instead of assuming the main project database only ([`5a983bc`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/5a983bc), [`d63f56c`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/d63f56c), [`4f232bb`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/4f232bb), [`d231bce`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/d231bce), [`d4df28f`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/d4df28f)).
- **Auto-import propagation** now reaches all routing callsites, fixing path normalization and reducing stale cross-workspace reads ([`506b6cf`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/506b6cf), [`911b793`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/911b793)).

### Storage and Config Hardening

- **Prefix normalization** is now integrated through config, storage, and ID handling so runtime issue prefix mismatches resolve consistently ([`bdc0243`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/bdc0243), [`0575380`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/0575380)).
- **Normalized prefixes** now drop trailing separator characters before ID generation, preventing malformed runtime prefixes from producing awkward double-separator IDs.
- **Frankensqlite compatibility** improved again: batched `DELETE` and other remaining batched `IN`-clause operations were replaced with row-by-row queries to avoid engine-specific breakage ([`ba71494`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/ba71494), [`b9a0f25`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/b9a0f25), [`45b2a4e`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/45b2a4e)).
- **Tombstone state handling** now keeps `closed_at` separate from `deleted_at`, records delete metadata when creating or importing tombstoned issues, and clears delete fields when an issue leaves tombstone state.
- **Doctor** now gives better guidance around root `.gitignore` conflicts and partial-index repair behavior ([`44d47e6`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/44d47e6), [`e6ef576`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/e6ef576)).
- **Agents command** handling is more robust for marker-block parsing, project-scoped search, and JSON output on mutating operations ([`1cf1aa9`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/1cf1aa9)).

### Release and CI

- **Release verification** now asserts that the built binary version exactly matches the release tag, closing a class of silent mis-versioning failures ([`3315bf5`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/3315bf5), [`b2a9ef5`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/b2a9ef5)).
- Packaging metadata and cache pinning were refreshed for release automation, and the Intel macOS build moved to the correct runner label ([`e137852`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/e137852), [`9f9f183`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/9f9f183)).

### Testing

- Added fresh regression coverage around blocked-cache close behavior, fresh-db behavior, custom status snapshots, lint routing, and the CI fixes required to keep those suites green ([`9869aca`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/9869aca), [`86f9c98`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/86f9c98), [`b657c0e`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/b657c0e), [`a1e893e`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/a1e893e), [`4cec0bb`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/4cec0bb), [`fe2ae0a`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/fe2ae0a)).

Focused hardening for concurrent agent workflows, plus a release-process cleanup pass.

### Storage and Reliability

- **Atomic config writes** using PID-scoped temp files to prevent partial-write corruption ([`e3a00e3`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/e3a00e3)).
- **Graceful missing-dependency fallback** in storage and graph code paths -- dangling dep references no longer crash ([`617572f`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/617572f), [`a1b63dd`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/a1b63dd)).

## [v0.1.0](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/releases/tag/v0.1.0) -- 2026-01-18 (Release, Draft)

Initial public release. A Rust port of [Steve Yegge's beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads), frozen at the "classic" SQLite + JSONL architecture.

### Core Feature Set

- **Full CLI** with all classic beads commands: init, create, list, show, update, close, reopen, delete, dep, blocked, ready, search, stale, count, stats, sync, doctor, q (quick capture).
- **SQLite + JSONL hybrid storage**: SQLite for fast local queries, JSONL for git-friendly collaboration.
- **Non-invasive design**: never executes git commands, never touches files outside `.beads/`, never auto-commits.
- **Agent-first**: every command supports `--json` for AI coding agent integration.
- **Dependency tracking** with cycle detection, blocked/ready issue management, and dependency trees.
- **Label system** with add/remove/list/list-all operations.
- **Comments** with add/list operations.
- **Config system** with layered precedence: CLI flags > env vars > project config > user config > defaults.

### Architecture (Built During Pre-v0.1.0 Development)

259 commits from project inception (2026-01-15) built the entire system from documentation and planning through to a fully functional CLI. Key milestones:

- Comprehensive porting plan and legacy architecture documentation ([`38cd152`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/38cd152), [`a376186`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/a376186)).
- Behavioral specs for all classic bd commands ([`15e4908`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/15e4908), [`76eb243`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/76eb243)).
- Core model types ([`562e021`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/562e021)).
- Classic CLI command scaffold ([`16c98b8`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/16c98b8)).
- Search, comments, doctor, sync commands ([`5444b9b`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/5444b9b), [`43b523b`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/43b523b), [`229ec5a`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/229ec5a)).
- E2E and conformance test suites ([`5304ba7`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/5304ba7)).
- Sync safety hardening with JSONL allowlist, path validation, and export error policies ([`cc605b2`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/cc605b2), [`6d30f92`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust/commit/6d30f92)).
