# beads_rust-yyxo: filesystem-witness regression script for br sync.
#
# Creates a workspace, runs `br sync --flush-only` and `br sync --import-only`,
# and uses Linux strace (or fall back to inotifywait, or a polling stat scan
# on macOS/other) to capture every filesystem mutation. Asserts each one is
# in the allowlist defined by SYNC_SAFETY_INVARIANTS.md PC-1 / PC-RECOVERY.
#
# Emits a structured JSON event log to /tmp/sync_safety_witness_<ts>.jsonl
# with one event per filesystem mutation:
#   {ts, op, path, allowed, reason_if_blocked}
#
# Exit codes:
#   0   all mutations within allowlist (PASS)
#   1   one or more mutations outside allowlist (FAIL — printed details)
#   2   prerequisite missing (br binary, tmpdir, etc.)
#   3   tracing tool unavailable (strace/inotifywait/dtrace)

# Phase 5 compares two sorted file lists with `comm`, which assumes both were
# sorted under the SAME collation it uses. Inherit the ambient locale and on a
# non-C one `sort` orders differently, `comm` refuses with "file 1 is not in
# sorted order", and under `set -e` the script dies mid-phase having emitted NO
# summary and NO verdict — a gate that fails opaquely rather than reporting
# violations. Observed locally 2026-09-05; CI runners happen to use C, which is
# why it never surfaced there. Pin it so the gate is deterministic wherever it
# runs.

# Mirror of is_allowed_sync_file in tests/e2e_sync_git_safety.rs.
#
# THIS COPY HAS DRIFTED BEFORE. It is a hand-maintained mirror of a Rust
# function, and the only thing keeping the two in step is the line above, which
# is a comment and cannot fail. When the Rust side gained the br write-lock
# prefixes and the fsqlite sidecar extensions, this copy did not, and the gate
# began failing main on files the Rust allowlist considered perfectly legal:
#
#   .beads/.br-jsonl-write-<24 hex>.lock   not in allowlist   (run 33935185228)
#
# If you add a case to either implementation, add it to BOTH. The parity test
# in tests/e2e_sync_git_safety.rs runs this function against the Rust one and
# fails when they disagree, which is what should have caught the drift above.
