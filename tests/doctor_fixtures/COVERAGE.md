# Doctor fixture coverage manifest (fm- finding ids → fixtures)

Maps every declared `fm-<subsystem>-<slug>` finding id to the fixture(s)
that exercise it, so coverage drift is visible in review. The mapping was
built empirically (beads_rust-yx0b): each fixture's planted state was run
through `br doctor --json` and the non-ok `details.finding_id` values
recorded; assert-side coverage (special env or flags driven by the
fixture's own `assert.sh`) is marked `assert`.

**Drift gate**: `tests/e2e_doctor_fixture_suite.rs::fixture_coverage_manifest_is_complete`
asserts that (a) every fm id in the `br doctor capabilities` envelope has a
row here, (b) every fixture named here exists on disk, and (c) every
fixture directory on disk is mentioned somewhere in this file. Adding a new
finding id or fixture without updating this manifest fails the gate.

Kinds: `detect` — the planted state fires the finding under plain
`br doctor --json`; `assert` — the fixture's `assert.sh` drives a special
invocation (env override or flag) to pin the finding/check contract;
`exception` — no fixture can fire the id, reason given inline.

| finding id | fixtures | kind |
|---|---|---|
| fm-agent_coordination-suspect-close-reason | audit_suspect_close_reasons | detect |
| fm-agent_coordination-workflow-status-out-of-set | workflow_status_out_of_set | detect |
| fm-caches_indexes-blocked-cache-stale | blocked_cache_stale, blocked_cache_content_mismatch, blocked_cache_table_missing, duplicate_config_rows, duplicate_metadata_rows | detect |

| fm-caches_indexes-labels-orphans | labels_orphans | detect |
| fm-caches_indexes-partial-index-stale | — | exception: fixer-scope id only (gates the REINDEX repair path via the fixer filter); no check emits it as a finding, so no fixture can fire it. Advertised in the capabilities envelope via `fixers[].filter_ids` (beads_rust-oow2) |
| fm-concurrency_primitives-orphaned-write-lock | orphaned_write_lock, mcp_serve_stale_write_lock, write_lock_symlink_node | assert: the probe contract (GH #395) classifies a free stale-mtime lock as ok via a non-blocking flock probe under `BR_DOCTOR_STALE_LOCK_THRESHOLD_SECS=0`; the warn path (`stale_unprobed`) is unreachable on a workspace whose doctor startup succeeds, because an unopenable lock degrades startup first (see permissions_write_lock_unwritable). write_lock_symlink_node (beads_rust-5sej) pins the fail-closed startup refusal for a symlinked lock node and that no stage touches the node or its target; the directory shape is covered by unit tests plus tests/e2e_doctor_write_lock_shapes.rs |
| fm-configs-gitignore-leaking-beads | gitignore_leaking_beads, gitignore_bare_pattern, inner_gitignore_append | detect |

| fm-external_artifacts-binary-version-mismatch | binary_version_mismatch | detect |
| fm-external_artifacts-multiple-br-in-path | multiple_br_in_path | detect: the fixture builds its own $PATH with two `br` entries; on dual-install developer hosts the finding also fires ambiently in every fixture |
| fm-observability-doctor-runs-dir-grows-unbounded | doctor_runs_dir_growth | detect |
| fm-observability-rust-log-noisy-breaks-json | rust_log_noisy_breaks_json | assert: the fixture's assert.sh runs doctor under a deliberately noisy RUST_LOG; the harness itself pins RUST_LOG=error, so the finding cannot fire under the plain run |
| fm-permissions-beads-dir-readonly | permissions_beads_dir_readonly | detect |
| fm-permissions-config-yaml-mode-leaks-secrets | config_yaml_secret_mode | detect |
| fm-permissions-db-sidecar-mode-too-open | — | exception: the detector fires deterministically on a planted 0664 `-fsqlite-ns-gate`, but no fixture can pin the post-repair / post-undo stages: every `br doctor` run opens the database, and the pre-open self-heal (GH #403, `heal_namespace_sidecar_modes`) restores owner-only mode inside that same run, so the chmod fixer has nothing left to do by the repair stage. Covered by unit tests instead — `cli::commands::doctor::tests::test_db_sidecar_mode_check_flags_and_repairs_over_permissive_sidecar` and `storage::sqlite::tests::over_permissive_namespace_sidecar_mode_is_healed_before_open` |

| fm-routes_external-routes-jsonl-corrupt | routes_jsonl_corrupt | detect |
| fm-schemas-issue-column-order-divergence | — | exception: only emitted via the `schema.inspect` inspection-error path (schema checks failed to RUN, not a detected column-order divergence); no deterministic real-world plant reaches it without first tripping db.open/schema.tables instead |

| fm-state_files-merge-artifact-stuck | merge_artifact_stuck | detect |
| fm-state_files-no-db-mode-db-checks-skipped | no_db_mode_marker | assert: the fixture's assert.sh runs `br doctor --no-db --json` and pins the ok-status marker check + finding id; a full run must not carry the marker |
| fm-state_files-orphan-tmp-files | orphan_tmp_quarantine | detect |
| fm-state_files-orphaned-write-lock | permissions_write_lock_unwritable | detect: env-skip protocol (exit 3) on hosts where permission bits do not bind (root / CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE) |
| fm-state_files-read-only-open-not-observational | healthy_workspace_baseline | assert: the healthy baseline pins that an observational doctor read leaves the database family byte-identical; dedicated read-only storage regressions exercise the emitted finding path |
| fm-state_files-recovery-artifacts-orphaned | recovery_artifacts_orphaned, recovery_artifacts_aged | detect |
| fm-state_files-sqlite-page-malformed | sqlite_page_malformed, doctor_mutates_without_fix | detect |
| fm-state_files-sync-merge-pending | — | exception: the id is emitted by the `sync.merge_pending` refuse gate, which fires only while a committed `br sync --merge` saga is still unreconciled. Planting one means writing the pending-merge metadata row by hand, and any repair stage then refuses every mutation by design, so a fixture round-trip would assert nothing beyond the refusal already covered by `cli::commands::doctor::tests::pending_sync_merge_read_only_inspector_rejects_duplicate_and_empty_rows` |
| fm-state_files-wal-oversized | wal_oversized_checkpoint | detect |
| fm-state_files-wal-shm-sidecar-orphan | orphan_shm_sidecar, wal_without_shm | detect: orphan_shm_sidecar fires the error; wal_without_shm pins the tolerated ok-path (WAL without SHM is legal after a clean close) |

## Fixtures without a dedicated fm- finding id

Meta-fixtures that pin contracts other than a specific finding; listed so
the reverse direction of the drift gate (every fixture dir is mentioned
here) stays complete:

- `healthy_workspace_baseline` — asserts the ABSENCE of findings on a
  freshly initialized workspace (the false-positive gate).
- `sqlite_version_downgrade` — pins the engine-version downgrade check's
  tolerated path; the check has no fm mapping in
  `CHECK_NAME_TO_FINDING_ID`.
- `doctor_mutates_without_fix` — meta-contract: a detect-only doctor run
  must not mutate the workspace (also listed above under
  fm-state_files-sqlite-page-malformed, whose corruption it reuses).
- `empty_database_with_jsonl` — plants a present-but-schema-empty DB;
  primary rows above: missing-required-table/column.
